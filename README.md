# Data-analysis [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PBenderLux/Data-analysis/master)
A collection of python 3 programs (Jupyter notebooks) for the analysis of magnetization and scattering data of magnetic nanoparticle samples. When you encouter problems, need help running the problems or want to discuss your results do not hesitate to contact me.

The programs can be run without downloading anything in an executable environment using mybinder.org by clicking on the link above (note: seems to work best with Firefox or Edge, I personally have problems when using Chrome). However, the loading may take quite long and the computational speed is very slow. Thus, I recommend to download the repository and to run the notebooks directly on your own computer. The following link provides all the necessary information on how to execute jupyter notebooks: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tryjupyter.html \
When you are new to python I recommend to first install Anaconda which conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
